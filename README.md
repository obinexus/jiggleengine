## üéØ Project Vision & Core Philosophy

### The Art of Movement & Cultural Expression

JiggleEngine transcends traditional animation frameworks by infusing **cultural vibes and artistic personality** into physics simulation. Think of it as a living organism that bounces with character‚Äîwhere every movement tells a story and every animation carries the essence of its creator's vision.

```
NLink ‚Üí PolyBuild ‚Üí JiggleEngine ‚Üí Cultural Expression Through Motion
```

**Core Innovation:** We don't just animate objects; we give them **culture, personality, and vibe**. Whether it's the fluid dance movement of a character or the physical jiggle that tells a deeper story, JiggleEngine transforms mechanical physics into artistic expression.

### System Architecture & Integration

```
NLink Dependency Resolution ‚Üí PolyBuild Orchestration ‚Üí JiggleFelix Physics Core ‚Üí Jiggle.exe Interface
```

**Technical Foundation:**
- **NLink:** Intelligent dependency resolution across multiple languages and asset systems
- **PolyBuild:** Orchestration layer ensuring harmonious choreography between physics, animation, and cultural elements
- **JiggleFelix:** The soul of the system - advanced physics engine that interprets artistic intent
- **Jiggle.exe:** Primary development interface combining Blender-like functionality with real-time vibe-driven physics

## üé® JiggleFelix: The Soul of Physics

### Vibe-Driven Physics Architecture

**JiggleFelix** revolutionizes physics simulation by incorporating **cultural and artistic context** into movement calculations. Unlike traditional rigid-body physics, JiggleFelix interprets the **energy, personality, and vibe** you want to inject into your creations.

```cpp
// JiggleFelix Core: Cultural Physics Integration
class JiggleFelix {
    struct VibeParameters {
        CulturalContext culture;    // Cultural movement influences
        EnergyProfile energy;       // Dynamic energy characteristics  
        PersonalityVector vibe;     // Artistic personality traits
        StyleModifier aesthetics;   // Visual style influences
    };
    
    struct MovementContext {
        PhysicsState physics;       // Traditional physics simulation
        CulturalInfluence culture;  // Cultural movement patterns
        ArtisticIntent intent;      // Creator's artistic vision
        VibeResonance resonance;    // Harmonic movement characteristics
    };
    
    // Core vibe-physics integration
    void UpdateWithCulture(float deltaTime, const VibeParameters& vibe);
    MovementResult ProcessArtisticIntent(const ArtisticIntent& intent);
};
```

### Cultural Movement Patterns

**Artistic Physics Categories:**
- **Fluid Dance Physics:** Graceful, flowing movements inspired by cultural dance traditions
- **Character Personality Physics:** Movement that reflects character traits and emotional states
- **Environmental Vibe Physics:** World physics that respond to artistic mood and atmosphere
- **Interactive Culture Physics:** Dynamic responses to user interaction patterns

## üñ•Ô∏è Jiggle.exe: Creative Development Interface

### Artistic Development Environment

**Jiggle.exe** serves as your primary creative workspace, combining the precision of professional 3D tools with the intuitive flow of artistic expression. Think Blender meets cultural physics with real-time vibe visualization.

**Core Interface Features:**
- **Real-Time Vibe Preview:** See cultural physics in action as you create
- **Cultural Physics Tuning:** Adjust personality, energy, and style parameters interactively
- **Artistic Intent Mapping:** Translate creative vision into physics parameters
- **Live Movement Choreography:** Orchestrate complex movement sequences with cultural context

### Development Workflow Integration

```javascript
// Jiggle.exe Creative Session
const creativeSession = new JiggleEngine.ArtisticSession({
    culturalContext: 'vibrant_pokemon_aesthetic',
    energyProfile: 'playful_bouncy',
    vibeIntensity: 0.8,
    physicsStyle: 'stylized_realistic'
});

// Load artistic reference for cultural physics
await creativeSession.loadCulturalReference('lisa_chicken7_energy.json');

// Begin vibe-driven physics creation
const characterPhysics = await creativeSession.createCharacter({
    personalityVibe: 'energetic_cheerful',
    movementCulture: 'anime_influenced',
